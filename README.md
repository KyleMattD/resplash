## `More Information`

I know it is bad practice to have the .env file on a repo, however I don't have enough experience or knowledge of interacting with API's

The project kind of works, I get a response back from the api, but I cant seem to display the information.

If you navigate to the architecture page, and inspect you can see there is a response from the api.
